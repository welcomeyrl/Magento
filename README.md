# Magento
It is an interview test however I failed

/**
 *
 * Razoyo Developer Test
 *
 * @author William Byrne <wbyrne@razoyo.com>
 *
 * The goal of this mini-project is to develop some PHP classes
 * that allow Magento product information to be displayed in several
 * different formats (CSV, XML, and JSON). Each record should ONLY include
 * the sku, product name, price, and short description.
 *
 * The CSV format must have a header row sku,name,price,short_description
 * 
 * You are not allowed to use any of the built-in PHP encoding functions (i.e. json_encode, SimpleXML, etc)
 *
 * You will be connecting to a Magento store that sells personalized greeting cards.
 * Be sure to use the SOAP V1 protocol.
 * It will take more than 1 API call to retreive the neccessary product information
 *
 * Magento API docs: http://www.magentocommerce.com/api/soap/introduction.html
 *
 * There are 2 external files that are included into this script.
 * 1. raz-lib.php - Razoyo provided classes and interfaces
 * 2. dev-lib.php - Where you should put any of your classes
 *
 * Feel free to email me if you have any questions
